#**Usage**#
To use this project, you must first upload an EPUB file for processing using the /upload_epub/ endpoint. Once the file has been processed, you can use the other endpoints to generate summaries, explanations, descriptions, translations, and definitions.

For example, to generate a summary of the uploaded EPUB file on a given topic, you can use the /resume/ endpoint and provide the topic as a parameter. To explain a given text from the uploaded EPUB file, you can use the /explain_text/ endpoint and provide the text as a parameter.
